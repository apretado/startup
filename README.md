## Elevator Pitch
In this game, everyone is given the same prompt that they must answer honestly. Everyone will be shown the answers but will not know which player submitted which response. The goal of the game is to correctly guess who submitted which response. Your score is the number of correct guesses **minus** the number of people who correctly guessed your response. "a competition that you've won."
